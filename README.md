# Show CJK with Bopomofo in Mandarin

# 顯示漢字的注音讀法

![Show CJK with Bopomofo in Mandarin](demo.png)


A [Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com/) plugin to display the Mandarin phonetic symbols in Bopomofo (Zhuyin, 注音符號). It might help you to learn the pronunciation of some rare Chinese characters / Kanjis.

**Noted that some pronunciations may not be recognized by the official education department. Also, depend on your IME, some pronunciation may not support.**

**請特別注意，部分讀音可能並不被官方的教育單位所承認（意即並不被視為「標準讀法」）；且基於您所使用的輸入法之詞庫，也有可能因並未收錄該讀音，使其無法輸入該漢字。**

## Installation

1. One-click install *Show CJK with Bopomofo in Mandarin* from *Window > Plugin Manager.*
2. Restart Glyphs.

## Requirements

The plug-in only test in Glyphs 3.1 (3133) & macOS Monterey (macOS 12). I can only test it in current app and OS versions, and perhaps it works on earlier and later versions too.
