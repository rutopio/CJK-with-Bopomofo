# 顯示漢字的注音讀法

![Show CJK with Bopomofo in Mandarin](demo.png)

- *Demo font: Noto Sans CJK SemiBold*


A [Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com/) plugin to display the Mandarin phonetic symbols in Bopomofo (a.k.a. Zhuyin, 注音符號). It might help you to learn the pronunciation of some rare Chinese characters / Kanjis.

Noted that some pronunciations may not be recognized by the official education department. Depend on your IME, some pronunciation may not support.

Also, not all of Chinese characters' / Kanjis' pronunciation have been collected in this repo. For example, CJK unified ideographs extension area in Unicode may be missed.

請特別注意，部分讀音可能並不被官方的教育或正音單位所承認或收錄（意即並不被視為「標準讀法」）；且基於您所使用的輸入法之詞庫，也有可能因並未收錄該讀音，使其無法輸入該漢字。

此外，因為漢字數量實在太多了，如在 Unicode CJK 擴充區中的字符可能並未收錄於其中。

## Installation

1. One-click install the plugin.
2. Restart Glyphs.
3. Click *View > Show CJK Pronunciation: Bopomofo/Zhuyin* to enable it.

## Requirements

The plug-in only test in Glyphs 3.1 (3133) & macOS Monterey (macOS 12). I can only test it in current app and OS versions, and perhaps it works on earlier and later versions too.
